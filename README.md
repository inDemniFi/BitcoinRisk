Backend logic lives in `app/api/chat/route.ts`. From here, you can change the prompt and model, or add other modules and logic.

## üß± Structured Output


For more details, [check out this documentation page](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/popular/structured_output).

## ü¶ú Agents

To try out the agent example, you'll need to give the agent access to the internet by populating the `SERPAPI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.
Head over to [the SERP API website](https://serpapi.com/) and get an API key if you don't already have one.

You can then click the `Agent` example and try asking it more complex questions:

This example uses the OpenAI Functions agent, but there are a few other options you can try as well.
See [this documentation page for more details](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/).

## üê∂ Retrieval

The retrieval examples both use Supabase as a vector store. However, you can swap in
[another supported vector store](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/) if preferred by changing
the code under `app/api/retrieval/ingest/route.ts`, `app/api/chat/retrieval/route.ts`, and `app/api/chat/retrieval_agents/route.ts`.

For Supabase, follow [these instructions](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/supabase) to set up your
database, then get your database URL and private key and paste them into `.env.local`.

You can then switch to the `Retrieval` and `Retrieval Agent` examples. The default document text is pulled from the LangChain.js retrieval
use case docs, but you can change them to whatever text you'd like.

For a given text, you'll only need to press `Upload` once. Pressing it again will re-ingest the docs, resulting in duplicates.
You can clear your Supabase vector store by navigating to the console and running `DELETE FROM docuemnts;`.

After splitting, embedding, and uploading some text, you're ready to ask questions!

For more info on retrieval chains, [see this page](https://js.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/).
The specific variant of the conversational retrieval chain used here is composed using LangChain Expression Language, which you can
[read more about here](https://js.langchain.com/docs/guides/expression_language/cookbook).

## üìö Learn More

The example chains in the `app/api/chat/route.ts` and `app/api/chat/retrieval/route.ts` files use
[LangChain Expression Language](https://js.langchain.com/docs/guides/expression_language/interface) to
compose different LangChain modules together. You can integrate other retrievers, agents, preconfigured chains, and more too, though keep in mind
`BytesOutputParser` is meant to be used directly with model output.
